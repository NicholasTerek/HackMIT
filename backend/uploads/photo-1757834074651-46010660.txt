This image shows a presentation slide or document being displayed on a screen in what appears to be a dimly lit room or classroom setting. The slide has a heading that reads "TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE" and contains text describing different types of knowledge, though much of the text is difficult to read due to the lighting and image quality.

On the right side of the slide, there's a section titled "WHAT YOU THINK YOU LOOK LIKE" with what appears to be an image of a person's head surrounded by various icons or symbols, likely representing information or digital content. Below that is another section labeled "WHAT YOU ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE" with what seems to be a simpler image.

At the bottom of the slide, there's text that mentions "So the sequence of steps" and references "imperative knowledge," suggesting this is likely an educational presentation about different categories or classifications of knowledge.

The overall setup suggests this is being used in an academic or training context, possibly for a computer science, information systems, or educational theory course. The dark environment indicates this was photographed during an active presentation.
