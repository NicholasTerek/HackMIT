This image shows a computer or television screen displaying what appears to be a YouTube video of a lecture or educational presentation. The video shows a woman with shoulder-length dark hair and glasses, wearing a dark-colored shirt, standing in what looks like a classroom or lecture hall. Behind her are blackboards or whiteboards with mathematical equations or formulas written on them.

The video has subtitles enabled, which show the text "That's probably the big thing right there." There's a YouTube player interface visible at the bottom of the screen, and on the right side, there appears to be a settings menu open showing playback speed options (with speeds like 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, Normal, 1.25 visible).

The screen itself appears to be photographed in a dark room, creating a contrast between the bright video content and the dark surroundings. This looks like someone watching an educational video, possibly a mathematics or science lecture, with the playback controls and subtitle options visible.
