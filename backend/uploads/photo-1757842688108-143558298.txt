A laptop computer sits on a dark surface displaying an educational webpage about chemical bonding and molecular interactions. The screen shows what appears to be an online course or lecture material with navigation menus on the left side and course information on the right. The laptop is positioned in front of windows, and the lighting appears dim, creating a nighttime study environment.
