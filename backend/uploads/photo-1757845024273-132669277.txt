A laptop displays a math problem on its screen showing an orange car traveling at 25 kilometers per hour through a city. The problem states "If it drives for 3 hours, then we can find" with the text appearing to be cut off. In the background, three people are sitting in what appears to be a dimly lit room or cafe setting.
