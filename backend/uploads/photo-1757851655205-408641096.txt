A laptop screen displays a presentation slide about "Representable Numbers" 
from Carnegie Mellon. The slide shows binary representations of decimal 
numbers and discusses floating point representation. In the bottom right 
corner, there's a small video feed showing what appears to be an instructor 
in a classroom setting.
