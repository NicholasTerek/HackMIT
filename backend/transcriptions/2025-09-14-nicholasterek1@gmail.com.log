[2025-09-14T00:14:10.167Z] Testing,
[2025-09-14T00:14:12.726Z] Oh wait, wo-
[2025-09-14T00:14:23.558Z] Are you using your charger?
[2025-09-14T00:14:25.252Z] Charger?
[2025-09-14T00:14:27.130Z] Is it down there or--
[2025-09-14T00:14:30.457Z] Because you're using, I'm assuming.
[2025-09-14T00:15:28.136Z] Where should I see the logging of your--
[2025-09-14T00:15:30.862Z] Do you know where I should see yours?
[2025-09-14T00:15:34.146Z] Like, oh, like the stuff I made?
[2025-09-14T00:15:34.752Z] Yeah.
[2025-09-14T00:15:36.232Z] Uh, there's two new ones.
[2025-09-14T00:15:38.026Z] Like di- like where the output go.
[2025-09-14T00:15:39.840Z] Where the output should be in terms of?
[2025-09-14T00:15:40.864Z] Oh, terminal code.
[2025-09-14T00:15:41.052Z] Yeah.
[2025-09-14T00:15:55.154Z] Wo- are your works? Wait.
[2025-09-14T00:15:56.045Z] Yay!
[2025-09-14T00:16:04.851Z] Okay, and then this is successful. This is the photo? This image shows the laptop preview displaying what appears to be a brown horse running in a field.
[2025-09-14T00:16:06.035Z] Yeah, same thing. Okay.
[2025-09-14T00:16:07.815Z] Is there anything else? So we took the photo?
[2025-09-14T00:16:10.719Z] And then this is the summary we got of it. Ye
[2025-09-14T00:16:11.955Z] ah. Yeah, and I can change the--
[2025-09-14T00:16:13.238Z] Add a system prompt too.
[2025-09-14T00:16:14.966Z] We, um, we can do a prompt, right?
[2025-09-14T00:16:16.645Z] You added a prompt?
[2025-09-14T00:16:18.617Z] So we can right now just describe the settings.
[2025-09-14T00:16:19.321Z] So yeah, we can--
[2025-09-14T00:16:21.539Z] Right, that'll be it. Yeah.
[2025-09-14T00:16:21.913Z] Nice.
[2025-09-14T00:16:22.396Z] Okay.
[2025-09-14T02:32:02.116Z] Like you're not guessing between like, 'Is this real?' or 'Can I give it a time of day?' It's like you know for certain. That's also true of the issue is, what is the baseline, right? Right now, if you hear this story, you don't know if it's from your right human or AI. So effectively, you are stuck where you don't have a prior to know what any degree of certainty who's writing this is a generator or not.
[2025-09-14T02:32:04.112Z] What's the benefit of having a tool like this?
[2025-09-14T02:32:06.016Z] The benefit of having a tool like this?
[2025-09-14T02:32:07.287Z] I actually thought like... I
[2025-09-14T02:32:10.117Z] f you know details about people, you can manipulate a complex...
[2025-09-14T02:32:11.085Z] Because if it's 20.
[2025-09-14T02:32:12.206Z] Which is why it's so dangerous.
[2025-09-14T02:32:13.518Z] I smooth in like other... Wh
[2025-09-14T02:32:17.440Z] ich is why AI is just so dangerous. Precisely because even...
[2025-09-14T02:32:19.210Z] Do you know like what triggers them? Like...
[2025-09-14T02:32:19.882Z] Logo.
[2025-09-14T02:32:27.051Z] Because you can figure out what triggers them and then just deploy it and use. Maybe it's a sense of control, like as the reader, you have all the control in the situation.
[2025-09-14T02:32:34.730Z] Maybe you can go for validation and it's generating this. Yeah, and then you like can control your you know, it creates value for you.
[2025-09-14T02:32:38.749Z] You can control your appetite towards always doing more of it. Oh, that's a good point.
[2025-09-14T02:32:39.640Z] Yeah.
[2025-09-14T02:32:40.875Z] So then the question is...
[2025-09-14T02:32:48.093Z] Can you use this to manipulate? And the idea is that if you don't have any context, right, you don't know what's going on. There's some guardrails.
[2025-09-14T02:32:52.323Z] I thought there were some manipulation in which you actually don't feel empathy as much.
[2025-09-14T02:32:54.188Z] That's a crazy question.
[2025-09-14T02:32:55.520Z] Yeah.
[2025-09-14T02:32:57.915Z] You could use that for your political stuff.
[2025-09-14T02:32:58.421Z] Oh, I am.
[2025-09-14T02:32:58.722Z] Okay.
[2025-09-14T02:33:12.946Z] I am. Especially on a texting side, right? How can you have one person text more than one person? Well, if you have details, you can auto-suggest texts that are shown. It's specifically has to mention details of the person that's typing to the chat.
[2025-09-14T02:33:21.921Z] The person should relate, right? You can find the rough texters that relate in some way through some shared criteria or affiliation or demographic.
[2025-09-14T02:40:31.802Z] It's mostly girls, I would say.
[2025-09-14T02:40:34.513Z] But I just wanted to be very cozy.
[2025-09-14T02:40:35.746Z] I think it's all girls, right?
[2025-09-14T02:40:39.893Z] Yeah, but are you guys not hosting anyone you don't?
[2025-09-14T02:40:41.583Z] Hmm?
[2025-09-14T02:40:42.994Z] Are you not hosting anyone you don't?
[2025-09-14T02:40:44.718Z] I'm at Harvard, so no.
[2025-09-14T02:40:45.297Z] Wait, what?
[2025-09-14T02:40:46.472Z] It's just MIT folks.
