[2025-09-14T09:09:27.648Z] And... Where's the other one
[2025-09-14T09:09:28.384Z] Where's the other one? Was it this one?
[2025-09-14T09:09:29.294Z] Yeah, this is Bun.
[2025-09-14T09:09:30.636Z] Bun. And it's working, okay.
[2025-09-14T09:09:32.217Z] Enough tea, take a photo?
[2025-09-14T09:09:34.585Z] It's just this Bun, right?
[2025-09-14T09:09:34.786Z] Yeah.
[2025-09-14T09:09:40.997Z] Wait, where's the--
[2025-09-14T09:09:46.683Z] Do you think we're losing it on good or on winning? If it's ten people who are judging me, I'm cooked and I'm dying.
[2025-09-14T09:09:49.891Z] We're gonna see.
[2025-09-14T09:09:51.192Z] Does it make a--
[2025-09-14T09:09:53.117Z] sound when it doesn't--
[2025-09-14T09:09:54.787Z] You're okay.
[2025-09-14T09:09:57.596Z] Are you doing mentor track one? I know mentor sponsor track.
[2025-09-14T09:09:59.739Z] I'm doing the BC one, yeah.
[2025-09-14T09:10:01.273Z] Oh, okay.
[2025-09-14T09:10:03.683Z] Okay, how do we stop the transcription?
[2025-09-14T09:10:06.003Z] Do we stop the app if we want?
[2025-09-14T09:10:09.142Z] Oh, is that how you stop the transcription?
[2025-09-14T09:10:12.069Z] Yeah, take another photo before you stop it. Take another photo before you stop it.
[2025-09-14T09:10:15.578Z] And await five seconds.
[2025-09-14T09:10:19.758Z] What am I waiting for?
[2025-09-14T09:10:26.321Z] That was good, okay. And now, can you go? Go into the web app now. Start the server. Oh wait, you didn't start the server.
[2025-09-14T09:10:28.583Z] Or is this-- hopefully the server's still running.
[2025-09-14T09:10:31.745Z] What do you-- no, where are you going?
[2025-09-14T09:10:33.303Z] Wait, this thing, right?
[2025-09-14T09:10:33.594Z] Yeah.
[2025-09-14T09:10:39.602Z] Yeah, it's on.
[2025-09-14T09:10:41.871Z] There it is.
[2025-09-14T09:10:44.122Z] Yes!
[2025-09-14T09:10:46.510Z] Okay, so it works on yours too.
[2025-09-14T09:10:47.331Z] Okay.
[2025-09-14T09:10:48.927Z] We've got the demo.
[2025-09-14T09:11:00.189Z] It's in beta. It should-- we'll blame it on the beta.
[2025-09-14T09:11:09.044Z] Sorry, we pushed the update last night and it bugged out.
[2025-09-14T09:11:09.575Z] Mm-hmm.
[2025-09-14T09:11:12.531Z] Okay, how do we stop this?
[2025-09-14T09:11:14.044Z] We can stop it. Control C.
[2025-09-14T09:11:15.949Z] Okay.
[2025-09-14T09:11:19.074Z] Do we have to do it like that to demo this?
[2025-09-14T09:11:19.949Z] What do you mean?
[2025-09-14T09:11:25.138Z] Like, there's no, like, thing in the app for this or anything? Okay. I mean, it's okay, it's just the demo.
