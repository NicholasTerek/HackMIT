[2025-09-14T09:09:27.648Z] And... Where's the other one
[2025-09-14T09:09:28.384Z] Where's the other one? Was it this one?
[2025-09-14T09:09:29.294Z] Yeah, this is Bun.
[2025-09-14T09:09:30.636Z] Bun. And it's working, okay.
[2025-09-14T09:09:32.217Z] Enough tea, take a photo?
[2025-09-14T09:09:34.585Z] It's just this Bun, right?
[2025-09-14T09:09:34.786Z] Yeah.
[2025-09-14T09:09:40.997Z] Wait, where's the--
[2025-09-14T09:09:46.683Z] Do you think we're losing it on good or on winning? If it's ten people who are judging me, I'm cooked and I'm dying.
[2025-09-14T09:09:49.891Z] We're gonna see.
[2025-09-14T09:09:51.192Z] Does it make a--
[2025-09-14T09:09:53.117Z] sound when it doesn't--
[2025-09-14T09:09:54.787Z] You're okay.
[2025-09-14T09:09:57.596Z] Are you doing mentor track one? I know mentor sponsor track.
[2025-09-14T09:09:59.739Z] I'm doing the BC one, yeah.
[2025-09-14T09:10:01.273Z] Oh, okay.
[2025-09-14T09:10:03.683Z] Okay, how do we stop the transcription?
[2025-09-14T09:10:06.003Z] Do we stop the app if we want?
[2025-09-14T09:10:09.142Z] Oh, is that how you stop the transcription?
[2025-09-14T09:10:12.069Z] Yeah, take another photo before you stop it. Take another photo before you stop it.
[2025-09-14T09:10:15.578Z] And await five seconds.
[2025-09-14T09:10:19.758Z] What am I waiting for?
[2025-09-14T09:10:26.321Z] That was good, okay. And now, can you go? Go into the web app now. Start the server. Oh wait, you didn't start the server.
[2025-09-14T09:10:28.583Z] Or is this-- hopefully the server's still running.
[2025-09-14T09:10:31.745Z] What do you-- no, where are you going?
[2025-09-14T09:10:33.303Z] Wait, this thing, right?
[2025-09-14T09:10:33.594Z] Yeah.
[2025-09-14T09:10:39.602Z] Yeah, it's on.
[2025-09-14T09:10:41.871Z] There it is.
[2025-09-14T09:10:44.122Z] Yes!
[2025-09-14T09:10:46.510Z] Okay, so it works on yours too.
[2025-09-14T09:10:47.331Z] Okay.
[2025-09-14T09:10:48.927Z] We've got the demo.
[2025-09-14T09:11:00.189Z] It's in beta. It should-- we'll blame it on the beta.
[2025-09-14T09:11:09.044Z] Sorry, we pushed the update last night and it bugged out.
[2025-09-14T09:11:09.575Z] Mm-hmm.
[2025-09-14T09:11:12.531Z] Okay, how do we stop this?
[2025-09-14T09:11:14.044Z] We can stop it. Control C.
[2025-09-14T09:11:15.949Z] Okay.
[2025-09-14T09:11:19.074Z] Do we have to do it like that to demo this?
[2025-09-14T09:11:19.949Z] What do you mean?
[2025-09-14T09:11:25.138Z] Like, there's no, like, thing in the app for this or anything? Okay. I mean, it's okay, it's just the demo.
[2025-09-14T09:31:34.084Z] Okay, so I've got the instrumental evacuation at the back test one, back test in here. I
[2025-09-14T09:31:37.202Z] Are there other ones? No, that's it. I'll save it.
[2025-09-14T09:31:44.160Z] So, as you can see, this audio should be transcribing in real time.
[2025-09-14T09:31:51.033Z] I will be testing this audio through several lectures, and a couple pictures.
[2025-09-14T09:31:53.675Z] So, we can just go the whole way up next time.
[2025-09-14T09:32:04.580Z] Okay.
[2025-09-14T09:32:13.534Z] And then I just keyboard interrupts Bun to stop this.
[2025-09-14T09:37:05.692Z] Now, do you work?
[2025-09-14T09:37:07.789Z] Hello?
[2025-09-14T09:37:09.270Z] Yes, okay.
[2025-09-14T09:37:11.906Z] So now we're going to test this.
[2025-09-14T09:56:21.367Z] Do you see this audio?
[2025-09-14T09:56:26.838Z] I will now end this audio recording.
[2025-09-14T09:56:30.885Z] Wait, I saw an error.
[2025-09-14T09:56:34.938Z] Go ahead.
[2025-09-14T09:56:37.956Z] What's that error?
[2025-09-14T09:56:39.604Z] Latency, maybe?
[2025-09-14T10:09:35.154Z] Now, it will work.
[2025-09-14T10:09:47.314Z] Hello, my name is Winston Ta, and today we are going to be testing a course from MIT OpenCourseWare on introductory biology.
[2025-09-14T10:09:58.511Z] Testing, testing, hello.
[2025-09-14T10:10:06.849Z] Micrometers, ananometers, uh, there is one unit that chemists and biologists use quite a lot, it's the angstrom.
[2025-09-14T10:10:17.127Z] After, um, a finish or, no, not finish, uh, I think it was a Norwegian, and that is equivalent to ten angstrom.
[2025-09-14T10:10:48.874Z] Equals one nanometer. So when you're looking at scales, we tend to talk about angstrom because they're a convenient number, but don't, uh, don't get fooled by this, it's a, you know, it can be a little bit confusing because it's ten to, ten to the negative ten, so nanometers ten to the negative nine, you know that quite frequently, picometer ten to the negative twelve, micrometer negative six, but the angstrom is just a funny unit. We use a lot and it's ten to the negative ten. So just to make sure there's no ambiguity about that, uh, that particular detail. Okay?
[2025-09-14T10:10:49.885Z] Can I give a URL?
[2025-09-14T10:10:58.117Z] Alright, so today's, uh, lecture will focus on the molecules of life, and in particular,
[2025-09-14T10:11:10.824Z] So we have just learned a bit about an introduction to biology, we learned about the angstrom, which is a particularly weird unit that concerns and is related to picometers and nanometers.
[2025-09-14T10:11:14.467Z] This concludes this test on MIT OpenCourseWare.
[2025-09-14T10:11:15.400Z] I noticed that--
[2025-09-14T10:11:17.029Z] And this test will now be suspended.
[2025-09-14T10:15:55.266Z] Testing,
[2025-09-14T10:16:08.296Z] Hello? My name is Winston Ta. And we will be doing an audio transcription and picture test of an introduction to calculus video.
[2025-09-14T10:16:22.796Z] If you are watching this, then you must finally be ready to learn calculus.
[2025-09-14T10:16:25.154Z] First of all, excellent work!
[2025-09-14T10:16:30.052Z] It's not easy to learn all of the required algebra and trigonometry just to make it this far.
[2025-09-14T10:16:33.224Z] Unfortunately, what lies ahead is no easy task either.
[2025-09-14T10:16:37.527Z] So, before we get down to business, let me give you an overview of what to expect.
[2025-09-14T10:16:41.358Z] You can decide for yourself if you're ready, and when you are, I'm here to help.
[2025-09-14T10:16:44.350Z] Alright, so what is calculus?
[2025-09-14T10:16:49.819Z] When it comes to calculus, you'll find that it's very different from much of the math you've probably studied so far.
[2025-09-14T10:16:53.571Z] This is because calculus is the mathematics that deals with change.
[2025-09-14T10:16:55.568Z] Now, what's that supposed to mean?
[2025-09-14T10:16:58.725Z] Let's take a look at a simple example to find out.
[2025-09-14T10:17:04.062Z] Let's suppose we have a car that goes exactly 25 kilometers per hour.
[2025-09-14T10:17:09.867Z] If it drives for three hours, then we can find that it will travel a total distance of 75 kilometers.
[2025-09-14T10:17:12.324Z] See? Nice and easy.
[2025-09-14T10:17:15.311Z] But this is not the change we are looking for.
[2025-09-14T10:17:22.096Z] Now let's suppose that due to road conditions, or the driver, the car is speeding up and slowing down.
[2025-09-14T10:17:25.163Z] In other words, its speed is changing.
[2025-09-14T10:17:32.416Z] Now that we have a more realistic problem, how can we determine how far the car will travel in three hours?
[2025-09-14T10:17:35.903Z] The answer lies in calculus.
[2025-09-14T10:17:40.301Z] There's just one example where we want to be able to mathematically handle a change.
[2025-09-14T10:17:42.683Z] Here's another quick example.
[2025-09-14T10:17:48.314Z] If I want to model the volume of a balloon, you might assume that it's approximately a sphere.
[2025-09-14T10:17:53.257Z] And then use the formula of volume equals four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.
[2025-09-14T10:17:56.965Z] This shows that the volume of a balloon is related.
[2025-09-14T10:18:08.457Z] This concludes this audio transcription test on an introduction to calculus video.
[2025-09-14T10:18:10.974Z] This test will now be suspended.
[2025-09-14T10:58:00.077Z] Test.
[2025-09-14T10:58:03.301Z] Nice and broke, there's people sleeping somewhere there.
[2025-09-14T10:58:03.917Z] Okay, nice.
[2025-09-14T10:58:05.895Z] Should we make it flatter?
[2025-09-14T10:58:09.399Z] I feel like ours is more interesting.
[2025-09-14T10:58:16.326Z] It may be one thing, if one thing.
[2025-09-14T10:58:23.876Z] Okay, and also let it cover with only one person with the glass at a time, so we definitely need a video. So the others can see.
[2025-09-14T10:58:27.021Z] What do you think, one person can see what?
[2025-09-14T10:58:29.641Z] Alright, gamers, today we're going to watch Peppa Pay play some Minecraft.
[2025-09-14T10:58:34.663Z] Do I do. Do you want to do the talking for the technical component?
[2025-09-14T10:58:35.653Z] Sure.
[2025-09-14T10:58:37.028Z] I'm Peppa Pay!
[2025-09-14T10:58:38.051Z] Like, can you wear the--
[2025-09-14T10:58:39.345Z] This is my little brother.
[2025-09-14T10:58:40.338Z] Come over here.
[2025-09-14T10:58:41.844Z] This is Mommy Pig.
[2025-09-14T10:58:43.875Z] But what for video submissions?
[2025-09-14T10:58:44.346Z] Daddy Pig.
[2025-09-14T10:58:45.067Z] Yeah.
[2025-09-14T10:58:45.103Z] Hey!
[2025-09-14T10:58:47.818Z] Peppa Pig!
[2025-09-14T10:58:51.099Z] Do we need me to? 'Cause I need to go to work.
[2025-09-14T10:58:52.104Z] No, you don't need anything.
[2025-09-14T10:58:55.501Z] Well, you can go later, but I feel like later would be more important.
[2025-09-14T10:58:59.290Z] Wait, my mom's more important.
[2025-09-14T10:59:00.307Z] For the video?
[2025-09-14T10:59:01.137Z] Wait, do you have one hour?
[2025-09-14T10:59:02.856Z] Like, is working on her computer.
[2025-09-14T10:59:04.981Z] Yeah, not in the video, but there's more time.
[2025-09-14T10:59:08.076Z] Yeah, but then we need-- we need to get a desk near the Wi-Fi over there.
[2025-09-14T10:59:10.939Z] There's no one going to clean the room.
[2025-09-14T10:59:13.640Z] George, we don't really want a mummy work on the computer.
[2025-09-14T10:59:14.846Z] We got the shit out of the garbage.
[2025-09-14T10:59:19.300Z] I think someone cleaned it up, but that's why I was giving you my stuff because I think someone's going to clean it.
[2025-09-14T10:59:21.877Z] George, you mustn't touch the computer either.
[2025-09-14T10:59:23.806Z] Yes, George!
[2025-09-14T10:59:25.572Z] You mustn't do this.
[2025-09-14T10:59:27.879Z] Peppa, stop!
[2025-09-14T10:59:30.533Z] What do we need to do here? There doesn't matter what's in the video.
[2025-09-14T10:59:31.136Z] Okay.
[2025-09-14T10:59:32.038Z] Okay, I think--
[2025-09-14T10:59:34.341Z] I don't think we have to do it by any means.
[2025-09-14T10:59:35.558Z] I think we do.
[2025-09-14T10:59:37.054Z] Look at you walking, yo.
[2025-09-14T10:59:38.773Z] We need a table for this submission.
[2025-09-14T10:59:41.338Z] And we need to do the submission. I don't know, but
[2025-09-14T10:59:42.340Z] I don't know, but it doesn't matter what table.
[2025-09-14T10:59:44.535Z] But we don't even know what the next steps in the submission are.
[2025-09-14T10:59:46.655Z] And where's it to write it down or something, like...
[2025-09-14T10:59:50.692Z] But we need a table so we can open up the form and actually get one form deeper.
[2025-09-14T10:59:51.793Z] In the submission.
[2025-09-14T10:59:53.900Z] Well, we're not filling out the form here.
[2025-09-14T10:59:55.171Z] We can't. We need
[2025-09-14T10:59:56.094Z] We need a table to fill it out.
[2025-09-14T10:59:57.905Z] Okay, let's...
[2025-09-14T11:00:01.413Z] It says look for location, because then the sponsors go to you.
[2025-09-14T11:00:02.730Z] Like, they need to know where--
[2025-09-14T11:00:05.340Z] Or let our old table and kick them out if they decide they care.
[2025-09-14T11:00:07.074Z] Or the old table. I don't know, I just feel like...
[2025-09-14T11:00:09.602Z] We have to go to fill out the table.
[2025-09-14T11:00:12.032Z] Who is the-- listen, who's the USB-C charger?
[2025-09-14T11:00:13.524Z] But I don't know where the disk is.
[2025-09-14T11:00:14.343Z] Well, not me.
[2025-09-14T11:00:14.937Z] Stop.
[2025-09-14T11:00:15.843Z] Nothing's coming up.
[2025-09-14T11:00:19.960Z] How many USB-C chargers are there?
[2025-09-14T11:00:22.604Z] Let's scroll, let's scroll.
[2025-09-14T11:00:24.304Z] What's this?
[2025-09-14T11:00:26.218Z] That's a video submission.
[2025-09-14T11:00:28.970Z] Wait, oh wait, my video submission.
[2025-09-14T11:00:30.028Z] Things.
[2025-09-14T11:00:34.112Z] Wait, is there any other USB-C?
[2025-09-14T11:00:36.229Z] Maybe.
[2025-09-14T11:00:39.424Z] Maybe put it somewhere in the corner just to be safe. We could ignore
[2025-09-14T11:00:39.811Z] could ignore it.
[2025-09-14T11:00:40.985Z] Okay, okay, okay.
[2025-09-14T11:00:41.574Z] Cover up.
[2025-09-14T11:00:42.689Z] Wait, what's your dad?
[2025-09-14T11:00:46.887Z] Look, he's tired. We need someone in the video to, like, I think it's best if you go.
[2025-09-14T11:00:47.676Z] I love Peppa Pig.
[2025-09-14T11:00:50.567Z] Say like, "I'm in the video room narrating the video," or...
[2025-09-14T11:00:53.046Z] No, no, no, you're the one wearing the glasses.
[2025-09-14T11:00:53.643Z] Mm-hmm.
